# Critical Thinking Module 1 - Part 1: Addition and Subtraction of Two Numbers

# have the user input the first number // num1
# have the user input the second number // num2
num1 = float(input("Enter a number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter a second number: "))

# calculate the sum of num1 and num2 and store it as var // sum_result
# calc the diff between num1 and num2 and store as var // difference_result 
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_reuslt = num1 - num2

# display the result of both operations 
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum_result)
print("The difference of the two numbers is:", difference_reuslt)
